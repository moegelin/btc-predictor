# Bitcoin Predictor

A web application that allows users to predict Bitcoin price movements in a fun and interactive way.

## Overview

## Usage

1. **Making Predictions**:
   - On the home screen, you'll see the current Bitcoin price

   - The chart shows price movements over time with your predictions marked


3. **Adjusting Settings**:
   - Go to the Settings tab to customize the application
   - Adjust the refresh timer to change how frequently the price updates
   - Use keyboard shortcuts (P to pause/resume, M to manually refresh when paused)

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized production files in the `dist` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```


## Development Notes

- The application currently uses simulated Bitcoin price data with random values
- Due to time constraints, the project structure is simplified and no tests are included

### Upcoming Features
- Integration with real Bitcoin price APIs for live data
- User authentication to save individual scores and settings
- Leaderboard to compare scores with other users
- Game statistics like win/loss ratio, biggest streak, games played etc.
- Rules and instructions or a tutorial for new users
